# training_monitoring_app
This is an example of a visualisation that can be used by high-performance units in professional team sports to monitor the external training load daily and weekly.

The app has been designed and deployed using Shiny.

Visualisations are populated with dummy data from a professional rugby union club competing in the Gallagher Premiership (UK).

The visualisation is made similarly to what is actually used on a daily basis at a professional rugby union club.
